# Python-for-STEM-Teachers-Workshop
This is a Programming Workshop for STEM Teachers

## Pre-requisites for this Workshop

**Nothing** :D

All you need is a gmail account (and sometimes maybe not even that!)
## Getting Started

To begin with this workshop it is recommended that you look at the [First notebook](Introduction_to_Markdown_and_Python.ipynb) to learn about the implementations of Markdown, LaTeX and Python inside Google Colab's version of a Jupyter Notebook.

Just click the ![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg) 

and you will instantly open the document online. 

**Recommendation** Either Save the `.ipynb` file to your google drive or open the notebook in *playground mode*


## If you want to run locally 
### Installing Jupyter Notebook
**Recommended method** 
You can install the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) for python which is filled with all the packages you will need. 


Or you can manually install Jupyter Notebooks in your computer along with some basic packages as mentioned below.

**You must have python3 installed in your computer for this to work**

[Follow these instructions first!!!!](https://jupyter.org/install)

### Copying the files locally

If you have a command line with bash you can have a local copy of all the files that will be used in the workshop

Just do the following 


*you can copy by either `ctrl-Shift-C` or simply by selecting the lines. You can paste in the command line by `ctrl-Shift-V` , `Shift-Ins` or `right-click`*

```shell
cd 
git clone https://github.com/GuillermoFidalgo/Python-for-STEM-Teachers-Workshop.git
cd Python-for-STEM-Teachers-Workshop/
```

From here you can run all the notebooks used in this workshop.
